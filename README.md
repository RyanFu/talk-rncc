# Talk: React-Native Custom Components

*Slides &amp; demo code of my talk in the [React-Native Sydney Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/React-Native-Sydney/events/231326406/) about native components.*

### Intoduction
Here are the slides and the demo code (working example) I used to talk about the creation of a native module for React-Native, and how awesome it is to extend your app by using some native code (iOS) and the power of the RCTBridgeModule.

### Get started

Make sure you have react-native installed.
```bash
$ npm install -g react-native-cli
```

Inside the project 'demo' folder, install the dependencies.
```bash
$ npm i
```

Run it!
```bash
$ react-native run-ios
```
